Collect 4 types of 'trash' and position them inside the center field the way you see in the picture: the ball symbolises an apple (bio-degradable), the blue CT2x2 symbolises some re-usable plastic trash and the cable stands for communal waste. Also, add a tissue or any kind of paper to the collection, too as paper waste."
