# LDrawResources
The repository stores all the LDraw & CAD resources for robot modelling

## Setup Bricklink Studio for build instruction creation
1. We use the **BrickLink LEGO Studio** for the build instructions. Download it here: https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page
2. **Install & Start** the Studio app for the first time to initialise folders
    - *Note: At the very first start the app might crash, don’t worry about it. Just start it again.*
3. After the first successful start close Studio
4. Open the **“Custom parts”** location 
    - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Stud.io\CustomParts`
    - Mac: Mac: `~/.local/share/Stud.io/CustomParts/`
    - *Note: Sometimes a fresh install comes without this folder and there's nothing to delete*
5. The Revolution Robotics custom models can be found in this repository: `/LDraw models`
6. **Copy** the `parts` and `connectivity` folders to the CustomParts folder
    - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Stud.io\CustomParts`
    - Mac: `~/.local/share/Stud.io/CustomParts/`
7. In **Studio**, from the dropdown on the left (by default set to Main), select Custom Parts
